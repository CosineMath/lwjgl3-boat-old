 * 
 * <p>This extension builds on {@link QCOMTextureFoveated QCOM_texture_foveated} by introducing a new foveation method bit that aims to reduce memory bandwidth by avoiding the
 * upscaling that occurred as part of the original extension.</p>
 * 
 * <p>With the original {@link QCOMTextureFoveated#GL_FOVEATION_SCALED_BIN_METHOD_BIT_QCOM FOVEATION_SCALED_BIN_METHOD_BIT_QCOM} foveation method, the render target in system memory is entirely populated. The lower
 * resolution framebuffer data is upscaled to fill the entire render target. The subsampled layout method introduced in this extension leaves the
 * framebuffer data at the calculated lower density and instead samples directly from the the lower resolution texels.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The primary usecase this is targeting is traditional VR pipeline. The application eye buffers would be rendered as textures with a subsampled layout
 * and then sampled by the warp process. Sampling from a texture with a subsampled layout requires a new sampler layout qualifier.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link QCOMTextureFoveated QCOM_texture_foveated}.</p>
